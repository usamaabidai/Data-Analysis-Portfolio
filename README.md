# Usama Abid - Data Analyst & Educator
## About
Hi, I’m Usama! I’m a freelance data analyst and a Super Tutor on Preply, where I teach Python and data analysis tools to students worldwide. I have a strong passion for working with data, solving problems, and helping others develop the skills needed to succeed in data analytics.

Currently, I am pursuing an RQF Level 6 Diploma in Artificial Intelligence Operations from Alnafi (EduQual). This program is helping me expand my knowledge in AI, automation, and advanced data analysis techniques.

With experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel, I enjoy working on real-world data projects and turning raw data into meaningful insights. My teaching approach is practical and hands-on, focusing on making complex topics easier to understand.

When I’m not analyzing data or teaching, I like exploring new technologies, improving my coding skills, and working on personal projects.
